# Image_Segmentation

Audio denoising has long been a focus of research,
with both traditional and deep learning methods being employed.
However, these approaches often involve manually
added artificial noise and result in suboptimal denoised audio
quality. To overcome these limitations, we have curated
a large-scale dataset of natural noise bird sounds and pioneered
the transformation of the audio denoising problem
into an image segmentation problem. We introduce the BirdAudioDenoisingModel,
utilizing 1,200 audio images. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that the BirdAudioDenoisingModel
achieves state-of-the-art performance in audio
denoising. Furthermore, our method proves to be versatile,
extending its applicability to speech denoising, audio
separation, audio enhancement, and noise estimation
